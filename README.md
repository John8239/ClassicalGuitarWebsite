This is a simple website about showing the different levels of playing the Classical Guitar in 5 videos!
- The 5 videos are arranged from simplest to hardest pieces on the Classical Guitar
- I provide a small amount of commentary about what makes each piece land in 
its respective level
- The website uses HTML and CSS
- Simply a page to celebrate an awesome and underrated instrument!
