<h1>Classical Guitar in Stages of Difficulty</h1>

<p>
    Classical Guitar is one of the most beautiful, diverse, and also one of the most
    underrated instruments found in the world. It also has quite a steep learning curve.
    Like many other instruments there are specific technical and physical requirements
    (think finger strength, for example) to play the guitar, however unlike almost every other
    instrument besides the piano, the guitar is a polyphonic instrument, meaning that it typically plays
    not only more than one note at a time, but also plays more than one melodic or harmonic
    line of music at a time (think of a melody line and a bass line both being played
    by the same guitarist).
    <br>
    <br>
    The guitar is also not very easy to understand to a beginner in terms of where the notes
    are on the instrument. Take the piano for instance with its pattern of 2 and 3 black
    keys. This can serve as a map for the pianist of the piano. For the guitar, the map is much
    more esoteric.

    <br>
    To fully appreciate the range of skill needed for Classical Guitar, I have selected 5 videos
    in order of increasing difficulty:
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Beginner: First we have 'Study in C Major' by Francisco Tárrega performed by Bradford Werner at
    'This is Classical Guitar' - Notice how all of the notes played are within the first 5 frets and only one note
    is played at a time.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Easy: Next we have 'Adelita' also by Tárrega performed by Taso Comanescu
    - Notice how notes are played further up the neck of the guitar and how more than one note is played at a time.

             encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Intermediate: Here we have 'Sonata in A Major, K.322' by Domenico Scarlatti performed by Scott Tennant, Professor
    of Classical Guitar at the University of Southern California (USC) - Notice how this piece has much more unique
    material than and is much longer than the prior two. Also in this piece you can hear a much more clear
    counterpoint (melody and bass lines) in which the guitarist must adequately make them clear and distinct from
    each other. Notice too how dynamic the piece is and how much movement the musician has to do to play it,
    along with more advanced techniques like trills.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Hard: This piece is the 'Grand Overture' by Mauro Giuliani performed by Raphael Aguirre - Here we have a truly
    difficult piece which has many sections to it, all being motivically and technically very different from the one
    before it. Many of the techniques Giuliani employs are quite demanding of the player, nevermind the stamina
    required to play such a piece. Ironically, Aguirre has one of the fastest runthroughs of this piece out there,
    clocking in at, unbelievably, under 7 minutes. For context, when most other guitarists play the Grand Overture
    the piece usually lasts around 9 minutes, give or take.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Professional: 'Zapateado' from the suite 'Tres Piezas Españolas' by Joaquin Rodrigo performed by Drew Henderson -
    This piece is hard. There is no getting around it. Rodrigo was primarily a pianist but loved composing for the
    guitar, however this disconnect with the instrument often led his compositions to be incredibly difficult.
    Given the speed, large jumps and movements along the neck used in short spans of time, among many other
    things, lands this piece as one of the few pieces at the final stage of Classical Guitar study.
    If you need any further proof of the difficulty of this piece, just jump to 1:57 and watch the
    nearly inhuman capabilities of Henderson as he pulls off one of the most brutal runs in the instruments repertoire.

    Clearly, these are not the only pieces that fit the mold of each difficulty category for the Classical Guitar.
    However, these are some of my favorites and I hope that you enjoyed them too. Thank you for visiting my site!
